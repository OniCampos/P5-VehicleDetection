**Vehicle Detection Project**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Perform a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature extraction on a labeled training set of images and train a classifier Linear SVM classifier
* Optionally, you can also apply a color transform and append binned color features, as well as histograms of color, to your HOG feature vector. 
* Note: for those first two steps don't forget to normalize your features and randomize a selection for training and testing.
* Implement a sliding-window technique and use your trained classifier to search for vehicles in images.
* Run your pipeline on a video stream (start with the test_video.mp4 and later implement on full project_video.mp4) and create a heat map of recurring detections frame by frame to reject outliers and follow detected vehicles.
* Estimate a bounding box for vehicles detected.

## [Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/513/view) Points
### Here I will consider the rubric points individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.

### Writeup / README

#### 1. Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one.  You can submit your writeup as markdown or pdf.  [Here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Vehicle-Detection/blob/master/writeup_template.md) is a template writeup for this project you can use as a guide and a starting point.  

You're reading it!

### Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)

#### 1. Explain how (and identify where in your code) you extracted HOG features from the training images.

The code for this step is contained in the third code cell of the IPython notebook.  

I started by reading in all the `vehicle` and `non-vehicle` images.  Here is an example of one of each of the `vehicle` and `non-vehicle` classes:

![alt text][image1]

I then explored different color spaces and different `skimage.hog()` parameters (`orientations`, `pixels_per_cell`, and `cells_per_block`).  I grabbed random images from each of the two classes and displayed them to get a feel for what the `skimage.hog()` output looks like.

Here is an example using the `YUV` color space and HOG parameters of `orientations=9`, `pixels_per_cell=(8, 8)` and `cells_per_block=(2, 2)`:

#### 2. Explain how you settled on your final choice of HOG parameters.

I tried various combinations of parameters. First of all, I split a part of the data in three training and test datasets. With this three datasets, I fixed all the parameters and I trained a linear SVM using different color spaces. The color space with the best test accuracy was the YUV. After that, I started to change the other parameters to see how the SVM would behave. The parameter that change the test accuracy the most is the hog channel that using all the channels takes longer to train but it achieves a better result. The other parameters has low influence on the SVM. So I decided to use the parameters that consumes a minimum amount of memory.

#### 3. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you trained a classifier using your selected HOG features (and color features if you used them).

The code for this step is contained in the fifth and sixth code cell of the IPython notebook.

I trained a linear SVM using the extracted features from the cars and not-cars dataset. First I normalized the dataset and define the labels as 0 for not-cars and 1 for cars. After that, I split the data in train and test datasets using 20% of the data for the test dataset. Finally I train the SVM classifier and the model achived a test accuracy of 0.9958.

### Sliding Window Search

#### 1. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you implemented a sliding window search.  How did you decide what scales to search and how much to overlap windows?

The code for this step is contained in the seventh code cell of the IPython notebook. 

I used a function called `find_cars()` that extract HOG features from the entire image and them for each window, it will sub-sampling the features to extract the features from that window. The function overlap the windows through the parameter `cells_per_step` and I used the value of 2. For the scales a used 1.0 and 1.6 because it was the best combination to detect close and far cars from the image.

#### 2. Show some examples of test images to demonstrate how your pipeline is working.  What did you do to optimize the performance of your classifier?

Ultimately I searched on two scales (1.0 and 1.6) using YUV 3-channel HOG features plus spatially binned color and histograms of color in the feature vector, which provided a nice result.  Here are some example images:

### Video Implementation

#### 1. Provide a link to your final video output.  Your pipeline should perform reasonably well on the entire project video (somewhat wobbly or unstable bounding boxes are ok as long as you are identifying the vehicles most of the time with minimal false positives.)
Here's a [link to my video result](./project_video_output.mp4)


#### 2. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you implemented some kind of filter for false positives and some method for combining overlapping bounding boxes.

I recorded the positions from the last 10 frames of positive detections in each frame of the video using the class `LastBoundingBoxesQueue()` (eleventh code cell of the IPython notebook). From the positive detections I created a heatmap and then thresholded that map to identify vehicle positions.  I then used `scipy.ndimage.measurements.label()` to identify individual blobs in the heatmap.  I then assumed each blob corresponded to a vehicle.  I constructed bounding boxes to cover the area of each blob detected.  

Here's an example result showing the heatmap from a series of frames of video, the result of `scipy.ndimage.measurements.label()` and the bounding boxes then overlaid on the last frame of video:

### Here are six frames and their corresponding heatmaps:

### Here is the output of `scipy.ndimage.measurements.label()` on the integrated heatmap from all six frames:

### Here the resulting bounding boxes are drawn onto the last frame in the series:

### Discussion

#### 1. Briefly discuss any problems / issues you faced in your implementation of this project.  Where will your pipeline likely fail?  What could you do to make it more robust?

One thing that can build up from this project is to make a more robust classifier. Most of the images used to train the classifier was withdrawn from the project video. Manually split the data between train and test dataset could improve the reliability of the test accuracy.

Other thing is to find better parameters on the slide windows implementation to get smoothier bounding boxes.
